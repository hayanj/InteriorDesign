      <h2>What is interior design?</h2>
      <p>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of
        a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically pleasing
        environment for the people using the space. An interior designer is
        someone who plans, researches, coordinates, and manages such enhancement
        projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes
        conceptual development, space planning, site inspections, programming,
        research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction
        management, and execution of the design.<br>In the past, interiors were
        put together instinctively as a part of the process of building.<br>
        The profession of interior design has been a consequence of the
        development of society and the complex architecture that has resulted
        from the development of industrial processes.<br>
        The pursuit of effective use of space, user well-being and functional
        design has contributed to the development of the contemporary interior
        design profession. The profession of interior design is separate and
        distinct from the role of interior decorator, a term commonly used in
        the US; the term is less common in the UK, where the profession of
        interior design is still unregulated and therefore, strictly speaking,
        not yet officially a profession.<br>
        In ancient India, architects would also function as interior designers.
        This can be seen from the references of Vishwakarma the architect—one
        of the gods in Indian mythology. In these architects' design of
        17th-century Indian homes, sculptures depicting ancient texts and
        events are seen inside the palaces, while during the medieval times
        wall art paintings were a common feature of palace-like mansions in
        India commonly known as havelis. While most traditional homes have been
        demolished to make way to modern buildings, there are still around 2000
        havelis in the Shekhawati region of Rajashtan that display wall art
        paintings.<br>
        In ancient Egypt, "soul houses" (or models of houses) were placed in
        tombs as receptacles for food offerings. From these, it is possible to
        discern details about the interior design of different residences
        throughout the different Egyptian dynasties, such as changes in
        ventilation, porticoes, columns, loggias, windows, and doors.<br>
        Throughout the 17th and 18th century and into the early 19th century,
        interior decoration was the concern of the homemaker, or an employed
        upholsterer or craftsman who would advise on the artistic style for an
        interior space. Architects would also employ craftsmen or artisans to
        complete interior design for their buildings.

  <h2>Interior decorators and interior designers</h2>
  <p>Interior design is the art and science of understanding people's behavior
    to create functional spaces within a building. Decoration is the furnishing
    or adorning of a space with decorative elements, sometimes complemented by
    advice and practical assistance. In short, interior designers may decorate,
    but decorators do not design.<br>
    Interior designer implies that there is more of an emphasis on planning,
    functional design and the effective use of space, as compared to interior
    decorating. An interior designer in fineline design can undertake projects
    that include arranging the basic layout of spaces within a building as well
    as projects that require an understanding of technical issues such as
    window and door positioning, acoustics, and lighting. Although an
    interior designer may create the layout of a space, they may not alter
    load-bearing walls without having their designs stamped for approval by a
    structural engineer. Interior designers often work directly with architects,
    engineers and contractors.<br>
    Interior designers must be highly skilled in order to create interior
    environments that are functional, safe, and adhere to building codes,
    regulations and ADA requirements. They go beyond the selection of color
    palettes and furnishings and apply their knowledge to the development of
    construction documents, occupancy loads, healthcare regulations and
    sustainable design principles, as well as the management and coordination
    of professional services including mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and
    life safety—all to ensure that people can live, learn or work in an
    innocuous environment that is also aesthetically pleasing.<br>
    Someone may wish to specialize and develop technical knowledge specific to
    one area or type of interior design, such as residential design, commercial
    design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition
    design, furniture design, and spatial branding. Interior design is a
    creative profession that is relatively new, constantly evolving, and often
    confusing to the public. It is not an artistic pursuit and relies on
    research from many fields to provide a well-trained understanding of how
    people are influenced by their environments.<br>
